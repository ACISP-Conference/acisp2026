          <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The 31st Australasian Conference on Information Security and Privacy
            (ACISP 2026) invites submissions of original papers presenting novel
            research results in all aspects of information security and privacy.
            This 31st ACISP will take place in Perth. We welcome papers
            presenting theories, techniques, implementations, applications, and
            practical experiences on a variety of topics.
          </p>

          <p>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px">
            <li>Blockchain technology</li>
            <li>Cryptology</li>
            <li>Database security</li>
            <li>Digital forensics</li>
            <li>
              Hardware, Side Channels, and Cyber-physical Systems Security
            </li>
            <li>Machine Learning and Security</li>
            <li>Network security</li>

            <li>System security</li>
            <li>Web Security</li>
          </ul>

          <b>Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers.</b>
          <p>
            We solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate,
            systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge for topics of
            broad interest to the cybersecurity community. Examples of SoK
            papers include papers that provide an important new viewpoint on an
            established, major research area, support or challenge long-held
            beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or provide an
            extensive and realistic evaluation and comparison of competing
            approaches to solving specific security problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            SoK papers must include the prefix “SoK:” in the title of the paper
            and will be reviewed by the full PC. They will be accepted based on
            their treatment of existing work and value to the community.

          <h3 id="instructions">Instructions for Authors</h3>

          <p>ACISP 2026 will have two rounds of submission:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Round 1 Deadline:</b><br />
            Paper submission: <b><s>27 Nov 2025</s></b
            ><br />
            Author notification: <b>15 Jan 2026</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Round 2 Deadline:</b><br />
            Paper submission: <b>26 February 2026</b><br />
            Author notification: <b>16 April 2026</b><br />
          </p>

          <p><b>Camera Ready: 30 April 2026</b></p>

          <p>
            The first round will have the results, including reject, major
            revision, and accept. For the major revision, we encourage authors
            to submit the updated manuscripts to round two. Round two only
            includes accept and reject.
          </p>

          <p>
            All submissions must be received by <b>11:59PM AoE (UTC-12)</b> on
            the day of the corresponding deadline. Submitted papers must not
            substantially overlap with papers that have been published or
            accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission
            to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.
            All submissions should be properly anonymized with no author names,
            affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references. Papers not
            properly anonymized may be rejected without reviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            All submitted papers will be evaluated based on their merits,
            particularly their importance to cryptography and cybersecurity,
            novelty, quality of execution, and presentation. For papers that
            might raise ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince
            reviewers that proper procedures (such as IRB approval or
            responsible disclosure) have been followed and due diligence has
            been made to minimize potential harm. Submissions not meeting the
            submission guidelines risk rejection regardless of their merits.
          </p>

          <h3>Special Tracks</h3>
          <!-- <p>
            We are in the process of planning different tracks, namely, a vision
            track and a PhD Symposium. We will make an announcement for these
            tracks together with the second round.
          </p> -->
          <p>
            In conjunction with the 31st Australasian Conference on Information
            Security and Privacy (ACISP 2026), ACISP 2026 is pleased to announce
            a Special Track to be held alongside the main conference. The
            Special Track aims to provide an additional venue for high-quality
            research that may not fit the scope or acceptance threshold of the
            main track, while maintaining the same academic standards and
            submission requirements as ACISP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authors submitting to the main track may be offered the opportunity
            to publish in the Special Track if their work is deemed valuable but
            not competitive enough for the main proceedings. All submissions
            will undergo rigorous peer review by the ACISP Program Committee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Accepted papers of the Special Track will be included in the new
            journal
            <a href="https://www.sciltp.com/journals/pc" target="_blank">
              Pragmatic Cybersecurity
            </a>
            and presented during the Special Track sessions.
          </p>

          <h4>Scope and Objectives</h4>
          <p>
            The Special Track invites original, unpublished research covering
            all areas of information security, privacy, cryptography, and
            cybersecurity systems. It is designed to:
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px">

              </ul>
              <p>
                Submissions should demonstrate tangible impact, practical
                insights, or industrial relevance.
              </p>
            </li>

            >. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or
            any supplementary material. Papers should be sufficiently
            intelligible and self-contained without appendices so that PC
            members can make decisions without reading appendices. Authors
            should not change any style of the LNCS format. Submissions not
            following the required format may be rejected without review.
          </p>
          <p>
            The proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag as a volume of
            the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Authors of accepted
            papers must guarantee that at least one of the authors will register
            and attend the conference and present their paper.
